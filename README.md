# Rust Tic Tac Toe

This project implements a simple command-line Tic Tac Toe game in Rust. The game allows two players to take turns placing their marks ('X' and 'O') on a 3x3 board until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- **Basic Gameplay**: Two players take turns to make moves on a 3x3 grid.
- **Winning Condition**: The game checks for a winner after each move.
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid moves such as out-of-bound indices and already occupied cells.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Runs entirely in the command-line interface.

## Requirements

- Rust (version 1.50.0 or newer)
